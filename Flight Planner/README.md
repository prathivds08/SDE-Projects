# Intelligent Flight Route Optimization System

## Overview

The Intelligent Flight Route Optimization System is a Python-based application that helps users find optimal flight routes between cities using graph algorithms and route optimization techniques.

The project models flights as a directed graph where:

* Cities are represented as nodes
* Flights are represented as weighted edges

Users can search for:

* Cheapest routes
* Routes with the least number of flights
* Least flights + cheapest combined routes

The system also includes route visualization using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

## Features

* Dynamic flight dataset using CSV files
* Interactive Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Cheapest route calculation
* Least flights earliest-arrival optimization
* Least flights cheapest-fare optimization
* Graph-based route visualization
* Directed weighted graph implementation
* Custom Queue and Heap data structures
* Real-world city and airline dataset

---

## Sample Dataset

The project uses a CSV-based flight dataset containing:

* Flight numbers
* Source and destination cities
* Departure and arrival times
* Fare information
* Airline names

---

## Route Visualization

The application visualizes:

* Cities as graph nodes
* Flights as directed edges
* Optimal routes highlighted in red
